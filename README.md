# Blackjack Game Create with Vanilla Javascript

## Description

This is a personal project in which I put into practice my skills in javascript, programming logic and good practices, thus creating a blackjack game.

## Game Rules

### Goal:
Get a higher hand value than the dealer without going over 21. 

### Dealing:
Each player and the dealer receive two cards, with the dealer's first card face up and the second face down. 

### Cards:
Face cards are worth 10, aces are worth 1 or 11, and other cards are worth their face value. 

### Play:
Players can choose to "hit" (ask for another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). If a player goes over 21, they "bust" and lose.

### Winning:
If a player's hand is higher than the dealer's without going bust, the player wins. If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
